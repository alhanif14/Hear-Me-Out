                <h1>About This Project</h1>
                <p>Web Based Speech Recognition is a website with a speech recognition feature with the aim of helping and making things easier for our friends who really need a special approach in getting information on a page on the internet, one of which is the blind's.  Users of this website can activate this speech recognition mode when touching the mic button or using the voice command "turn on the mic" then the system will start listening to the commands given and make movements according to the user's commands.</p> <br>
                <p>This website can solve the problems faced by some of our blind friends, namely difficulty in reaching the information on news pages due to their inability to see and read.  With this website, it is hoped that users will be helped to solve this problem by being able to read the news using a different approach, namely with speech recognition which will produce sound from the reading on the news page. The feature that users can use when they have activated this feature is with voice commands, users can move pages, scroll the website, read the text on the page just by using command keywords that have been set in this Web Based Speech Recognition. The system on this website will process and produce sound from the commands that have been given.</p>
